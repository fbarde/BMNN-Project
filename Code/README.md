# BMNN-Project
Project 1 of Course Biological Modelling of Neural Network

Each exercise of the Project 1 has its own Python file, named corresponding to the title of the exercise.
Running the main of each Python file allows to print the values of the parameters found, and plot the figures asked.


**1.1 Getting started :** implementation_HH.py

**1.2 Rebound spike? :** rebound_spike.py (and implementation_2.py and rebound2.py for comparision with Exercise 5)

**1.3 Adaptation :** adaptation.py

**2.1 Passive properties :** Passive_properties.py

**2.2 Exponential Integrate and Fire :** Exponential_Integrate_and_Fire.py

**2.3 Subthreshold adaptation :** Subthreshold_adaptation.py

**2.4 Remaining parameters :** Remaining_parameters.py

**2.5 Testing on random input :** Random_input.py
